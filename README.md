# Hard_Versus_Soft_Magnetic_Microrobots

This repository supports the paper *"Propulsion Performance Comparison of Hard- and Soft-Magnetic Microrobots Under Rotating Magnetic Fields."* 
It contains all files needed to reproduce the experimental setup, control electronics, magnetic array optimization, and microrobot designs.

**Repository Structure**  
The repository is divided into four main chapters:

**1. Rotating Magnetic Field Setup** – All parts, bill of materials, SolidWorks assembly files, STL files for 3D printing, and DXF files for laser cutting.  
**2. Electronics** – Wiring diagrams, manuals for the electronic components, Arduino code, and Nextion display code.  
**3. Magnetic Optimization Code** – Python script for optimizing the magnetic array.  
**4. Microrobots** – Microrobot designs, STL files, and pre-configured Formlabs files.
